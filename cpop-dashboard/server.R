# Currently the application displays the most recent water quality data from MarineGEO's LoggerNet server. 
# Ultimately, this application will allow users to display, query, and download chemical and physical sensor data including water quality and meterological data across a range of quality control levels, from raw and unprocessed to highly curated.
